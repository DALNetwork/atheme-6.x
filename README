atheme-services -- a set of services for IRC networks
=====================================================

This program is free but copyrighted software; see the COPYING file for
details.

Information about atheme-services may be found at http://www.dalnetwork.org/.

- GETTING SUPPORT
------------------

If you are stuck, or services are doing something really weird, or you have
some sort of brilliant idea, we have a channel on IRC! (Surprising, no?)
To access this channel, connect to irc.dalnetwork.org, and join #help.

It is important to note that operating Atheme in obviously insane
configurations automatically loses your support privileges.

- REPORTING BUGS
-----------------

If you find a bug in services, you must report it via the bugtracker; 
our developers have a tendency to forget things. Your bug is not 
actually a bug until it's reported.

Report bugs at http://www.dalnetwork.org/.
